# Static Comp Challenge

The goal of this project was to, given a provided image, use CSS and HTML to create a static website with the same layout of the original. It needed to display on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, as well as on mobile devices. The image I received looked like this:

Given the image above, I decided to make a dessert compilation website. It has links to different dessert recipes and includes prep times and main ingredients.

This is the Chrome display:

It uses adaptive design.
